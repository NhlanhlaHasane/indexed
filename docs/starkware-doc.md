## Name

Starkware

## Description

StarkEx leverages STARK technology to power scalable self-custodial transactions (trading & payments) for applications such as DeFi and gaming. Integrating with StarkEx allows an application to significantly scale and improve its offering and to bring in new business, while requiring very little changes to its existing setup. 

StarkEx currently supports ETH, ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens, and can readily support tokens on other EVM-compatible blockchains.

StarkEx is a mature platform that has been deployed on Ethereum Mainnet since June 2020. Prior to its Mainnet deployment, over 50M StarkEx transactions were settled on both public and private Ethereum testnets.
